            <h2>Damned Soggy Oat Patch</h2>
              <p>Fictioning a way through a labyrinthine ecosystem of narrative histories
              <br><br>
              Practitioners from BSc Digital Arts Computing present the exhibition and public programme “Damned Soggy Oat Patch”. Drawing on ideas and theories from Ursula K. Le Guin’s “The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction” to question and compose a remixed understanding of the fluid boundaries between fictions, fabulations, and non-fictional narratives.
              <br><br>
              Take a stroll through the labyrinth of installation, game art, mixed reality, video, sculpture, photography and mixed-media as the exhibiting artists play to their narrative strengths, calling to processes of creative symbiosis as …space, matter, technology, time, and fiction... collide.
              <br><br>
              Through engaging with “fiction” as an ongoing artistic practice of “fictioning”, “Damned Soggy Oat Patch” provokes the viewer to question and challenge presupposed notions of certainty, linearity and narrative history. By creating, recreating, and re-mixing a range of immersive experiences, the artists guide the viewer through as they re-contextualise the margins between the real, the uncanny, and the otherworldly altogether.
              <br><br>
              Damned Soggy Oat Patch opens Thursday 4th of May at 6pm,  continues 11am-8pm Fri/Sat/Sun. </p>

              <p><br>Agata Genissel works with experimental modes of fiction through a range of computational processes. This piece explores an experimental podcast format, using spatial audio techniques to critique the language of authority reflected in dominant tones throughout society. As these spatial dynamics reflect the attitudes of authority embodied by her characters, the artist encourages you to put on the headphones for further immersion.  
                <br>
                Also working with real-time audio synthesis software, no input-mixing and live electronics, she will use these techniques to re-sample and deconstruct the work in a live performance context.

              <p><br>The Jack Brown Show, Ep.303: ‘Fighting the Good Fight’ 
                <br><br>
                “Enter the four overlords of the universe. The language of authority booms loudly as it makes conspiracies out of thin air, expanding the four corners of the room into the four pillars of space and time - bending to the wills of our speakers. They world-build through their distaste and ignorance, relating to each other in a bid to reject the despair that o’ so desperately creeps into their world vision. These are the bros that need each other now more than ever; but, most of all, these are the bros that fail to do themselves any favours: they must extinguish chaos, impart all knowledge, and of course, fight the good fight.  
                <br><br>
                Episode 303 voices respected hot takes from Dr Jon Miller, Pete Clark, Steven Forbes and, the one and only, Jack Brown. Sponsored by Crudbucks.”  
                <br><br>
                This piece plays on and parodies the languages of authority through the prism of toxic masculinity and hyper-conservatism; these socio-cultural agendas, that fester in society’s subconscious, are expanded on through the format of the “bro-cast”. </p>

              <h2>AURYN REEVE</h2>
              <p><br>Auryn is a multimedia artist that specialises in moving image and computational art. Their practice involves using emerging techniques of knowledge generation, particularly from a queer interpretation of reality. Investigating  the construction of identities in virtual settings they demonstrate how corporeal acts might establish agency and the capacity for resistance within digital landscapes. Their initiatives, which range from generative machine learning models to video manipulation, are depicted in surrealist artwork that reveals the flood of information that pervades our digital experience. Responding to the current state of queer people navigating online places, they have authored critical essays such as 'Rendering Queer Bodies in Virtual Spaces,' which can be seen on the CLOT Magazine website.</p>
              <p><br>This project titled ‘Subject Permanence” investigates methodologies for the subject to establish agency and a communal sense of belonging. This is particularly evident within virtual spaces as emerging environments to develop and nurture identity formation. As a speculative work comprising of moving image and interactive virtual environment,  its purpose is to archive queer ephemera and  moments of collective experience that would otherwise be lost within heteronormative  trajectories of time and data accumulation. Images and footage have been processed through adversarial neural networks that generate a virtual embossing of archived media. Through these methods the understandings on the permanence of queer experiences is reconfigured to produce new potentiality for representation within data.</p>

              <p><br>In her third and final year at Goldsmiths, Isabella Blue is a visual artist who’s practice revolves around their identity and personal experiences. Creating works using moving image, computation, installation and ethnography. Isabella has been working around the theme identity as a way of starting to understand herself. A learning experience as well as an art practice, these topics lead her into working in the digital realm, which brings us to the 2023 exhibited work called “Self-Curation” </p>
              <img src="assets/artist images/Isabella Paterson.jpeg">
              <p><br>“Self-Curation” is an examination of the different forms we take, depicting identity in two realms, offline and online, which are always changing. Altering identities though a mixed media approach of photography and physical computing. 
                <br><br>
                This piece is a way of questioning the online self, how it effects our sense of reality and how we are perceived or perceiving others. The personal collection of work is a conversation of identity confusion. Taking experiences of the artist and questioning the ideas surrounding self-curation and identity. Looking to learn and explore the ideas behind one’s true self by attempting to answer the questions posed by Erving Goffman’s 1956 theory “The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life”, turning them into conversational pieces for others to contribute to and to provoke critical thinking surrounding the question “who am I?”.</p>

Pieces currently revolve around digital worlding, procedural generation, simulation and story worlds. Presently working with the Unity game engine as well as openFrameworks with C++, in the future I hope to delve more into digital storytelling, immersive experiences, and game development to create more expansive worlds and stories with more interaction. </p>
              <p><br>My piece for Damned Soggy Oat Patch is Nowhere Actually Existing. Created in Unity, it is an exploration of simulation and the concept of a utopia. Through using simulation as a way to illustrate how a person sees the world, I present my personal view of a utopia with visions of a harmonious ecosystem and sustainable community in tune with the world around it. However, it is merely a simulation; it isn't real, and it will never physically exist. This utopia isn’t real, and it will assure you’re aware of this.

                Is dreaming about pre social media times melancholy porn? 
                <br><br>
                (Mis)information Kiosk is an installation about living terminally online, in a positive feedback loop of information. My attention span is mutating in response to the short video, tiktok-reel-story format. I am engaging in a dialogue with the algorithm by responding to the content I want it to show me, delving into the recesses of the data flowing through the structures of social media platforms. As the answer, I built an instrument that allows me to create cut up remixes of footage found on Instagram and Tiktok, expressing my own version of the cacophony I experience on my feed. The shift into a process based work allows to create artworks ad infinitum. 
                This multichannel video manipulation tool is used to explore the practice of meme culture production known as shitposting, where bursts of poor quality content are released to overload the algorithm. I want to contribute to the collapse between high and low culture. Presenting tiktoks in a gallery space might seem cringe, another meme culture term meaning a brazen naïveté or an unfamiliarity with the protocols of a particular community. Could TikToks be considered art? Accepting a reality where short format content perverts the collective psyche is an uncomfortable, yet liberating feeling. 
                By alluding to the form of the monolith combined with an information kiosk of corrupted internet media, I hope to stress how meaningful these contemporary changes to the mind are, altering the dopamine release system permanently, evolving humans through its own cultural product, constantly optimized for maximum profit.</p>

                A pose detection machine learning model is running live, over two performances by Isabella Pinto. 
               The program is repeatedly looking for the most similar still frames to compare and display over the video input. A conversation has been manufactured between two strangers, Gerry Mitchell and Voldy Moyo, where they speak in Deptford and Wakefield respectively, of love within a ‘shabby landscape’. 
               The aluminium structure is a physical accompaniment to the movement and the words of these three people, who are all drawn to as well as constricted by the cityscape’s ever developing terrain.  </p>

              <h2>TIFFANY TANG</h2>
              <p><br>Tiffany Tang(b. 2001, Taipei) is an artist who works with video, performance, installation, and creative computing. Her work explores the relationship between the body, intimacy, and desire, and seeks to trace the connections between the inner and outer self. Through her practice, she employs multiple meanings through different constructs and explores the fetishization of objects and materiality.</p>
              <img src="assets/artist images/Tiffany Tang.png">
              <p><br>“all women you are human” is translated text from a pre-trained text model of Shin Yuan Gao's *Soul Mountain*. When looking for a literary expression to carry out the feeling of "seeking", the algorithmic path brings *Soul Mountain* from the ancient Chinese literature *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. The *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, also known as *Shanhai jing*, is an anonymous compilation of mythological geography, medicine and creatures. *Soul Mountain* explores the relationship between humans and the natural world that draws heavily from *The Classic of Mountains and Seas.* Auto-generated text becomes expressive and psychic as each character emerges from a mouse click. The generated text suggests an ambiguous narrative here. Thoughts are expressed through text, but when the machine learns from the text, does its meaning stay the same?</p>

              <p><br>As someone who has experienced a difficult past, I turned to art initially as a means of therapy and self-expression. However, as I continue to grow and evolve, I question my motives and the role that creating art plays in my life. Is it merely a way to revisit and reconcile my past, or does it hold an alternative significance for my future? This piece is an exploration of that internal conflict.
                <br><br>
                Using Pure Data and two speakers accompanied by acoustic structures, I create an immersive sound experience that gives the illusion of echoing. In this piece, the echoes serve as a metaphor for my past and internal chaos. They continue to reverberate in the present, becoming increasingly distant as time passes. I question how this distance will shape and influence my future decisions.
                <br><br>
                The sound in this piece embodies a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, much like my own personal journey. It also represents a willingness to embrace the unknown, the possibility of change, and forgiveness as I seek to transcend the limits of my personal experience.</p>

              <p><br>What drives people to meet each other? I believe those casual coincidences are reminding you of the answer. Welcome to my garden. Looking at my face, what is in your mind? The hardest part you have overcome and are ready to protect your gain. Your life is about to change dramatically... The media circulates the news that makes people extremely anxious, but the reality is more painful and cruel. As small individuals, how lucky we are to have the opportunity to meet each other in this vast world. War, race, discrimination, people hurt each other intentionally or unintentionally. Staring at my face, we are so different but so close to each other.
                <br><br>
                This work was inspired by Polish writer Stanisław Lem's 1961 science fiction novel Solaris, and records my most sensitive moments. Eventually, it will drift in the sea, burn-in ashes and disappear in silence. This work records my most sensitive moments. Personal memory has nothing to do with you, has nothing to do with him or her. When I disappear, it also disappears. We live together, and the gap between us is so deep. What I feel painful or happy may not be felt by others. We are all independent individuals, but I believe some connection between us can resolve the contradiction. I try to arouse everyone's resonance with the most personal things, because we all have one thing in common, that is, we are all special. This time I tried to open myself. You are welcome to come in and have a look.
